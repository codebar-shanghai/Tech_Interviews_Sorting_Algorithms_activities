    "### What is the RSA Algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **RSA algorithm** is a widely-used cryptographic method that allows secure data transmission. It is an asymmetric encryption algorithm, meaning it uses two keys: a **public key** for encryption and a **private key** for decryption. The public key is shared openly, allowing anyone to encrypt messages, but only the holder of the private key can decrypt them. The security of RSA relies on the fact that factoring large numbers (products of two large prime numbers) is computationally difficult. This makes it a cornerstone of modern encryption, used in securing sensitive data, digital signatures, and ensuring the privacy of communications online.\n",

    "#### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Convert the message to numerical values**:\n",
    "   - Use the ASCII value of each character in the string. You can obtain the ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function.\n",
    "   \n",

    "     \\text{{cipher\\_text}} = \\text{{(message\\_number}}^e) \\mod n\n",

    "### **Use AI to Review RSA: What to Memorize vs. What to Know**\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare for a coding interview where RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption is discussed, especially in the context of a project built with it, the candidate should **both memorize key concepts** and **understand deeper technical aspects** of RSA. Here’s a breakdown of what to focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Key Concepts to Memorize:**\n",
    "These core principles should be well understood and quickly recallable during an interview.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Asymmetric Encryption:** Understand RSA as an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm, which uses two keys: a **public key** for encryption and a **private key** for decryption.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Prime Numbers:** RSA relies on two large prime numbers. These primes are multiplied together to create the **modulus** (`n`), a critical component of both the public and private keys.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Public and Private Key Generation:**\n",
    "  - **Public Key:** Consists of the modulus `n` and the public exponent `e`.\n",
    "  - **Private Key:** Consists of the modulus `n` and the private exponent `d`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Euler’s Totient Function (ϕ(n)):** Understand the role of Euler's Totient function in key generation. Specifically, `ϕ(n)` is calculated as `(p-1)(q-1)` where `p` and `q` are the prime numbers used to generate `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encryption Formula:**  \n",
    "  - **Ciphertext (C)** is generated by: `C = M^e mod n`\n",
    "  - Where `M` is the plaintext message, `e` is the public exponent, and `n` is the modulus.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Decryption Formula:**  \n",
    "  - **Message (M)** is recovered by: `M = C^d mod n`\n",
    "  - Where `C` is the ciphertext, `d` is the private exponent, and `n` is the modulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modular Arithmetic:** Familiarity with modular exponentiation, the core mathematical operation in RSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Deep Technical Understanding:**\n",
    "The following deeper concepts and technical details should be understood to confidently explain how RSA works in practice, as well as the trade-offs and real-world implementation considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Generation Process:**\n",
    "  - Understand how large prime numbers are generated (e.g., using probabilistic algorithms like Miller-Rabin primality test).\n",
    "  - Explain how to compute the public and private exponents (`e` and `d`) using the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse of `e` mod ϕ(n).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Choosing `e` and `d`:**\n",
    "  - The value `e` is usually chosen as 65537 because it offers a good balance of security and computational efficiency. Understand why `e` must be coprime with `ϕ(n)`.\n",
    "  - `d` is computed as the modular inverse of `e` mod ϕ(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security Strength of RSA:**\n",
    "  - Understand **why large primes** (at least 2048 bits) are needed to secure RSA against modern attacks.\n",
    "  - Be familiar with the **difficulty of factoring** large composite numbers (the basis of RSA’s security), and the significance of quantum computing in this context (potential threat through Shor’s algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limitations of RSA:**\n",
    "  - RSA is relatively slow for encrypting large data directly. Typically, RSA is used to encrypt symmetric keys (in hybrid encryption systems) rather than large files.\n",
    "  - Be ready to explain how hybrid encryption works: RSA encrypts a symmetric key (e.g., AES key), and the symmetric key then encrypts the actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Common RSA Vulnerabilities:**\n",
    "  - Be prepared to discuss common security vulnerabilities, such as weak random number generation in prime selection, **padding attacks** (e.g., PKCS#1 v1.5 padding vulnerability), and side-channel attacks (timing attacks).\n",
    "  - Be familiar with solutions to these vulnerabilities, such as **padding schemes** like OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding) to prevent chosen-ciphertext attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Practical Implementation:**\n",
    "  - If the project involved implementing RSA, be ready to discuss how key generation, encryption, and decryption were implemented.\n",
    "  - You should be familiar with any **libraries** used (e.g., `PyCryptodome` in Python or OpenSSL), why they were chosen, and how they handle key management and padding.\n",
    "  - If applicable, discuss how you ensured the security of your implementation, such as using secure random number generation for primes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Example Project Discussion:**\n",
    "When discussing a project involving RSA, emphasize the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem Solved:** Why did you choose RSA? Was it for secure communication, data integrity, or digital signatures?\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Implementation Details:** How did you implement the RSA algorithm? Did you build it from scratch, or use a cryptographic library? Be specific about your process for key generation, encryption, and decryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance and Optimization:** How did you address RSA’s performance limitations? Did you use RSA in combination with symmetric encryption (e.g., AES for data and RSA for the key)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security Considerations:** What security measures did you take to prevent common attacks (e.g., padding schemes, key size)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Key Points to Be Confident About:**\n",
    "- You understand the **mathematical foundation** of RSA.\n",
    "- You can explain **why RSA works** and why it is secure (based on the difficulty of factoring large primes).\n",
    "- You can talk about **trade-offs** (speed, key length, security risks) and **how to mitigate** the vulnerabilities.\n",
    "- You can demonstrate how you **implemented RSA** in a project, including challenges and how you overcame them.\n",
    "\n",

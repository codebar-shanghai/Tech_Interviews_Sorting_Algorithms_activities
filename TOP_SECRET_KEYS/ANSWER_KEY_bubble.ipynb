    "**What is an Algorithm?**\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm is a set of instructions that is used to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task. It is a well-defined procedure that takes some input, processes it, and produces a corresponding output. Algorithms can be expressed in various forms, such as natural language, flowcharts, pseudocode, or programming languages. Bubble sort is an example of an algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a Sorting Algorithm?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A sorting algorithm is a type of algorithm that is used to arrange a list of items in a specific order, such as ascending or descending order. Sorting algorithms take a collection of data as input and produce a sorted collection as output. The goal of a sorting algorithm is to rearrange the data in a way that makes it easier to search, retrieve, or analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Bubble Sort?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly iterating through a list of items and swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm continues to iterate through the list until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted. Bubble Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that it preserves the order of equal elements, and it has a time complexity of O(n^2), making it less efficient than other sorting algorithms for large datasets. However, Bubble Sort is easy to implement and can be useful for small datasets or educational purposes."

    "**Goal:**  \n",
    "By the end of this activity, you should have a clearer understanding of the balance between algorithm memorization and writing idiomatic code.

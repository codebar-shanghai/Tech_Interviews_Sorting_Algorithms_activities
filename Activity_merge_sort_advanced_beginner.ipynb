    "### **Summary: What to Memorize vs. What to Know (Merge Sort)**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memorize**:\n",
    "  - **Time Complexity**:  \n",
    "    - Best-case, worst-case, and average-case \\(O(n \\log n)\\).\n",
    "  - **Space Complexity**:  \n",
    "    - \\(O(n)\\) due to the need for auxiliary space during merging.\n",
    "  - **Basic Pseudocode**:  \n",
    "    - Memorize the general recursive process of splitting the array in half, recursively sorting each half, and merging them back together in sorted order.\n",
    "  - **Idiomatic Code**:  \n",
    "    - Familiarize yourself with idiomatic practices in the languages you use, such as recursive calls and list slicing in Python, or array copying in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Know Deeply**:\n",
    "  - **How Merge Sort Works**:  \n",
    "    - Understand the divide-and-conquer approach: the array is divided into halves, recursively sorted, and then merged back together in sorted order. Be comfortable explaining the recursion and merging steps.\n",
    "  - **When and Why to Use Merge Sort**:  \n",
    "    - Merge Sort is stable and efficient on large datasets, making it suitable for situations where a stable sort is required or when memory usage is not a primary concern. It's also great for external sorting (e.g., sorting large datasets stored on disk).\n",
    "  - **Limitations**:  \n",
    "    - Know the space overhead of \\(O(n)\\) and why Merge Sort might not be the best choice for memory-constrained environments compared to in-place algorithms like Quick Sort or Heap Sort.\n",
    "  - **Idiomatic Coding Practices**:  \n",
    "    - Be able to write idiomatic Merge Sort implementations in different languages. Understand the recursion and merging process for each language’s syntax and best practices (e.g., recursive functions in Python, array handling in Java, or efficient merging in JavaScript)."

### **Key Explanations**:

- **Best/Worst Time Complexity¹**: These describe the algorithm’s time performance in optimal and worst-case scenarios. For example, **Bubble Sort** has a best-case time complexity of **O(n)** when the data is already sorted, but its worst-case is **O(n²)** when the data is completely unsorted.
  
- **Space Complexity¹**: Refers to the amount of memory the algorithm requires relative to the input size. **Merge Sort** uses **O(n)** additional space because it requires an auxiliary array for merging.

- **Use Cases²**: Describes the most typical scenarios where the algorithm is applied in real-world programming. For example, **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is used in **pathfinding** or **exploring graphs**.

- **Memorize¹ or Understand²**: Some algorithms, like **Bubble Sort** and **Binary Search**, should be memorized as they are simple and often asked in interviews. Others, like **Quick Sort** and **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, require a deep understanding of their mechanics and when they should be applied but may not require memorization of every line of code.

### **Memorization (¹)**:
- You should **memorize** core sorting algorithms (like Bubble Sort¹ and Binary Search¹) because of their simplicity and common use in interviews.
- For more advanced algorithms like Merge Sort¹ and Quick Sort¹, you should memorize the **structure** and typical recursion patterns but don’t need to memorize every detail.
  
### **Understanding (²)**:
- You should **understand** the underlying principles behind **graph traversal algorithms** (BFS², DFS², Dijkstra’s²) as these are fundamental for navigating tree and graph structures.
- **Dynamic Programming²** is often more about understanding **how** to apply it to a problem than memorizing specific solutions.
- **Space complexity²** is equally important to understand since real-world problems often require efficient memory management.

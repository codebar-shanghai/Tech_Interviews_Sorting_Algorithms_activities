    "\n",
    "An algorithm is a set of instructions that is used to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task. It is a well-defined procedure that takes some input, processes it, and produces a corresponding output. Algorithms can be expressed in various forms, such as natural language, flowcharts, pseudocode, or programming languages. Bubble sort is an example of an algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a Sorting Algorithm?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A sorting algorithm is a type of algorithm that is used to arrange a list of items in a specific order, such as ascending or descending order. Sorting algorithms take a collection of data as input and produce a sorted collection as output. The goal of a sorting algorithm is to rearrange the data in a way that makes it easier to search, retrieve, or analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Bubble Sort?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly iterating through a list of items and swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm continues to iterate through the list until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted. Bubble Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that it preserves the order of equal elements, and it has a time complexity of O(n^2), making it less efficient than other sorting algorithms for large datasets. However, Bubble Sort is easy to implement and can be useful for small datasets or educational purposes."

    "#### **Links to the Problem:**\n",
    "- **Chinese version of the Bubble Sort problem:** [leetcode.cn/problems/boats-to-save-people](leetcode.cn/problems/boats-to-save-people)\n",
    "- **International version of the Bubble Sort problem:** [leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people](leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Both links direct to the same LeetCode problem. Use the link that works best for your device and location.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Prerequisites:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is Top-Down Programming?**\n",
    "   - Top-down programming is an approach where the overall problem is divided into smaller sub-problems or tasks. You begin with the highest-level function and gradually break it down into smaller, more specific functions or steps, addressing each one individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What is Pair Coding?**\n",
    "   - Pair coding, also known as pair programming, involves two developers working together at the same workstation. One person writes the code (the \"Driver\"), while the other reviews each line as it is written (the \"Navigator\"). They switch roles frequently.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     - One partner writes the Bubble Sort algorithm while the other checks the logic and ensures it follows the problem requirements. After completing part of the code, they switch roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n",
    "   - Visit the provided link and read through **LeetCode Problem 881. Boats to Save People**. Make sure both partners understand the problem statement, input, and output requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Step 2: Apply Top-Down Programming**\n",
    "   - Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems. Discuss with your partner the main function and the necessary smaller steps to solve the problem.\n",
    "   - For example:\n",
    "     1. Identify the heaviest and lightest people that can be paired.\n",
    "     2. Write a function to determine if they can share a boat.\n",
    "     3. Implement the logic to count the minimum number of boats.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Step 3: Pair Code**\n",
    "   - One partner should begin coding while the other provides feedback and ensures the logic is correct. Take turns as Driver and Navigator.\n",
    "   - Start by writing the function to implement the Bubble Sort algorithm if necessary.\n",
    "   - Use top-down programming to implement the solution for the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Step 4: Test and Debug**\n",
    "   - After writing the code, test it using the test cases provided in the problem statement.\n",
    "   - Work together to debug any issues by identifying where the logic may be incorrect, and refine the code as needed.\n",
    "   - Use the available tools on LeetCode or your preferred AI tool to assist with optimization.\n",
    "   - Make sure to discuss and understand any changes made to the code to ensure both partners grasp the reasoning behind the modifications. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Step 5: Submit the Solution**\n",

    "### **Activity 4: Understanding Time Complexity of Bubble Sort by Counting Comparisons**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "To help you calculate the time complexity of the Bubble Sort algorithm step-by-step by counting how many comparisons happen during the sorting process. We'll break this down in a simple way and use basic math to calculate how efficient the algorithm is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Step 1: Understand How Bubble Sort Works**\n",
    "   - Bubble Sort compares each pair of adjacent elements and swaps them if needed. The larger elements \"bubble\" to the end of the list with each pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Step 2: Count the Comparisons in Each Pass**\n",
    "   - In the first pass through the array, the algorithm compares all but the last element. In the second pass, it compares one fewer, and so on. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   For example, in an array with 5 elements, the number of comparisons in each pass will be:\n",
    "   - First pass: \\(4\\) comparisons (because there are 4 pairs to compare).\n",
    "   - Second pass: \\(3\\) comparisons.\n",
    "   - Third pass: \\(2\\) comparisons.\n",
    "   - Fourth pass: \\(1\\) comparison.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Task:**  \n",
    "   Fill in the blanks for the number of comparisons made for an array of 6 elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Sample Array:\n",
    "   [8, 4, 1, 6, 3, 7]\n",
    "\n",
    "   - First pass: _____ comparisons\n",
    "   - Second pass: _____ comparisons\n",
    "   - Third pass: _____ comparisons\n",
    "   - Fourth pass: _____ comparisons\n",
    "   - Fifth pass: _____ comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Step 3: Add Up the Comparisons**\n",
    "   - To find the total number of comparisons, add the number of comparisons made in each pass.\n",
    "   - For example, if you had 5 elements:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 \\text{ comparisons in total.}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Task:**  \n",
    "   For an array of 6 elements, calculate the total number of comparisons:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\_\\_\\_ + \\_\\_\\_ + \\_\\_\\_ + \\_\\_\\_ + \\_\\_\\_ = \\_\\_\\_ \\text{ comparisons in total.}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Step 4: Use the Formula to Calculate Time Complexity**\n",
    "   - The formula for finding the total number of comparisons in Bubble Sort is:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "     Where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in the array.\n",
    "   - **Example:** If you have 5 elements, the formula gives:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\frac{5(5-1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10 \\text{ comparisons.}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Task:**  \n",
    "   Now, use the formula to calculate the total number of comparisons for an array of 6 elements.  \n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\frac{6(6-1)}{2} = \\_\\_\\_ \\text{ comparisons.}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Step 5: Discuss Time Complexity**\n",
    "   - As you can see, the total number of comparisons grows quickly as the size of the array increases.\n",
    "   - The time complexity of Bubble Sort is \\(O(n^2)\\), which means that as the number of elements \\(n\\) increases, the number of comparisons grows roughly as \\(n \\times n\\).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Task:**  \n",
    "   Discuss with your partner why Bubble Sort becomes slower for larger arrays. Fill in the blanks for the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For an array with 5 elements, the total number of comparisons is ____.\n",
    "   - For an array with 10 elements, use the formula to find the total number of comparisons:  \n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\frac{10(10-1)}{2} = \\_\\_\\_ \\text{ comparisons.}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - For an array with 100 elements, how many comparisons would be made in total (hint: use the formula)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reflection:**  \n",
    "Why do you think Bubble Sort becomes inefficient as the array size increases? How does the number of comparisons affect the overall speed of sorting? Think about why faster algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort are used for larger arrays."

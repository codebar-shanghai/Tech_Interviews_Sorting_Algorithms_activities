Activity Respository: https://github.com/codebar-shanghai/Tech_Interviews_Sorting_Algorithms_activities.git

1. **Reflect on Mistakes**: If you make an error, take a moment to reflect and document your thoughts. Specifically:
   - What was the mistake?
   - What was your initial misunderstanding?
   - How would you explain the correct concept in your own words?

   Reflecting this way helps reinforce the concept and provides a valuable reference for future review, aiding in solidifying the corrected understanding. Create a markdown block in the Jupyter notebook file below the activity where the mistake occurred, and write your notes there.

2. **Avoid Copy and Paste**: This activity emphasizes **active recall**â€”retrieving information from memory and expressing it in your own words. This practice enhances retention and deepens understanding. Copying and pasting bypasses this process, so instead, focus on recalling and rewriting the information yourself to actively engage with the material.

3. **Utilize AI (Without Code Completion Tools)**: You are encouraged to use AI tools such as **ChatGPT** or **HuggingFace** to assist your learning. These tools are great for clarifying concepts, but refrain from using code completion tools like **CodeWhisperer** or **GitHub Copilot** during this exercise. The goal is to read, understand, and rephrase the material in your own words to enhance comprehension.

4. **Using the Answer Keys**: The answer keys are available in the "TOP_SECRET_KEYS" folder. Please refrain from consulting them until you have completed the activity or are truly stuck and have exhausted other resources. Use the keys only as a last resort to review your work or clarify challenging concepts.

As a new user, you may not be familiar with working with `.ipynb` files, which are Jupyter Notebook files used for interactive coding. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to work with and open `.ipynb` files in GitHub Codespace:

**What is GitHub Codespace?**
GitHub Codespace is a cloud-based development environment that allows you to create, edit, and run code in a web-based interface. It's integrated with GitHub, so you can easily manage your code and collaborate with others.

**Step 1: Create a new repository or clone an existing one**

1. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to the repository you want to work with.
2. If you want to create a new repository, click the "New" button and follow the prompts to create a new repository.
3. If you want to work with an existing repository, click on the repository name to open it.

**Step 2: Open GitHub Codespace**

1. Click on the "Code" button in the top-right corner of the repository page.
2. Select "Open in Codespace" from the dropdown menu.
3. GitHub Codespace will open in a new tab or window, depending on your browser settings.

**Step 3: Open the `.ipynb` file**

1. In the GitHub Codespace interface, navigate to the folder containing your `.ipynb` file.
2. Click on the `.ipynb` file to open it in the Jupyter Notebook interface.
3. You may see a prompt asking you to select a kernel (e.g., Python 3.9) to run the notebook. Choose a kernel that matches the language you're using in your notebook.

**Step 4: Work with the `.ipynb` file**

1. Once the notebook is open, you can start working on it by adding new cells, editing existing cells, and running code.
2. Use the toolbar at the top of the screen to create new cells, run code, and access other features.
3. You can also use the keyboard shortcuts to navigate and edit the notebook.

**Step 5: Save and commit changes**

1. As you work on the notebook, make sure to save your changes regularly.
2. Click on the "File" menu and select "Save" to save your changes.
3. When you're ready to commit your changes, click on the "Code" menu and select "Commit" to create a new commit.
4. Add a commit message and click "Commit" to save your changes.

**Tips and Tricks**

* You can use the GitHub Codespace interface to create new files, including `.ipynb` files.
* You can also use the "File" menu to upload new files to your repository.
* To collaborate with others, you can invite them to your repository and give them permission to edit `.ipynb` files.
* GitHub Codespace has a built-in debugger and other tools to help you debug and optimize your code.

I hope this helps you get started with working on `.ipynb` files in GitHub Codespace! If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.

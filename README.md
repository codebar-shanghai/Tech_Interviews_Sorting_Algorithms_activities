# **Workshop Instructions**

1. **Open Markdown Files in Preview**: To view markdown (.md) files in Preview, right-click on the file name and select **"Open Preview"**. This will enable you to easily interact with the markdown files.

2. **Reflect on Mistakes**: If you make an error, take a moment to reflect and document your thoughts. Specifically:
   - What was the mistake?
   - What was your initial misunderstanding?
   - How would you explain the correct concept in your own words?

   Reflecting this way helps reinforce the concept and provides a valuable reference for future review, aiding in solidifying the corrected understanding. Create a markdown block in the Jupyter notebook file below the activity where the mistake occurred, and write your notes there.

3. **Avoid Copy and Paste**: This activity emphasizes **active recall**â€”retrieving information from memory and expressing it in your own words. This practice enhances retention and deepens understanding. Copying and pasting bypasses this process, so instead, focus on recalling and rewriting the information yourself to actively engage with the material.

4. **Utilize AI (Without Code Completion Tools)**: You are encouraged to use AI tools such as **ChatGPT** or **HuggingFace** to assist your learning. These tools are great for clarifying concepts, but refrain from using code completion tools like **CodeWhisperer** or **GitHub Copilot** during this exercise. The goal is to read, understand, and rephrase the material in your own words to enhance comprehension.

5. **Using the Answer Keys**: The answer keys are available in the "TOP_SECRET_KEYS" folder. Please refrain from consulting them until you have completed the activity or are truly stuck and have exhausted other resources. Use the keys only as a last resort to review your work or clarify challenging concepts.

    "### What is the RSA Algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **RSA algorithm** is a widely-used cryptographic method that allows secure data transmission. It is an asymmetric encryption algorithm, meaning it uses two keys: a **public key** for encryption and a **private key** for decryption. The public key is shared openly, allowing anyone to encrypt messages, but only the holder of the private key can decrypt them. The security of RSA relies on the fact that factoring large numbers (products of two large prime numbers) is computationally difficult. This makes it a cornerstone of modern encryption, used in securing sensitive data, digital signatures, and ensuring the privacy of communications online.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding the RSA Algorithm Activity:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on coding activity, participants will collaborate to implement the RSA encryption and decryption process in Python. The exercise will be broken down into several steps, allowing participants to explore the key components of RSA, such as generating large prime numbers, creating public and private keys, encrypting a message with the public key, and decrypting it using the private key. \n",
    "\n",
    "This activity will provide a hands-on experience with both the mathematical foundations and practical applications of cryptography, while also reinforcing problem-solving skills in coding."

    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prime Number:** A number greater than 1 with no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n",
    "- **Random Choice:** The `random.choice()` function selects a random element from a list.\n",
    "- **Distinct Values:** Ensure that two selected prime numbers are not equal by using a `while` loop to reselect if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The function should handle all cases where prime numbers are less than 150. However, since the total number of primes under 150 is limited (there are 35), the function will always be able to find two distinct primes.\n",
    "- If you extend this tool to handle larger ranges, ensure that the performance of the `is_prime` function is optimized (e.g., for much larger numbers).\n"

    "### Instructions for Software Engineers to Code the **Main Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following instructions outline how to implement the **main function** It uses a loop to interact with users, allowing them to encode multiple messages before exiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Prime Number Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** In the RSA algorithm, two prime numbers (`p` and `q`) are required to calculate the public and private keys.\n",
    "- **How to Implement:**\n",
    "  - Call the `generate_prime_pair()` function to randomly generate two prime numbers.\n",
    "  - Display the generated primes (`p` and `q`) to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Key Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** RSA requires public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt messages. The public key is composed of `e` and `n`, while the private key is `d`.\n",
    "- **How to Implement:**\n",
    "  - Use the `Find_Public_Key_e(p, q)` function to calculate the public key.\n",
    "  - Use the `Find_Private_Key_d(e, p, q)` function to calculate the private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **User Interaction Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** The user will input messages to be encrypted and decrypted. The application will continue to prompt the user until they decide to stop.\n",
    "- **How to Implement:**\n",
    "  - Create a loop that runs as long as the user enters `1` (indicating they want to encode another message).\n",
    "  - Prompt the user to input a message for encryption.\n",
    "  - Encrypt the message using the `Encode(n, e, message)` function and display the encrypted message.\n",
    "  - Decrypt the ciphertext using the `Decode(n, d, cipher_text)` function and display the decoded message.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 4. **Loop Exit Condition**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** The program should allow the user to stop encoding messages by entering `0` when prompted.\n",
    "- **How to Implement:**\n",
    "  - Check if the input is `1` (continue) or `0` (exit).\n",
    "  - If the user enters `0`, the loop exits, and the program ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Top-Level Entry Point**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the main function runs only when the script is executed directly and not when it is imported as a module.\n",
    "- **How to Implement:**\n",
    "  - Add the `if __name__ == \"__main__\": main()` block at the end of the script.\n",
    "- Note: the `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` block has been added for you below. \n",

    "To prepare for a coding interview where RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption is discussed, especially in the context of a project built with it, the candidate should **both memorize key concepts** and **understand deeper technical aspects** of RSA. Here’s a breakdown of what to focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Key Concepts to Memorize:**\n",
    "These core principles should be well understood and quickly recallable during an interview.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Asymmetric Encryption:** Understand RSA as an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm, which uses two keys: a **public key** for encryption and a **private key** for decryption.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Prime Numbers:** RSA relies on two large prime numbers. These primes are multiplied together to create the **modulus** (`n`), a critical component of both the public and private keys.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Public and Private Key Generation:**\n",
    "  - **Public Key:** Consists of the modulus `n` and the public exponent `e`.\n",
    "  - **Private Key:** Consists of the modulus `n` and the private exponent `d`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Euler’s Totient Function (ϕ(n)):** Understand the role of Euler's Totient function in key generation. Specifically, `ϕ(n)` is calculated as `(p-1)(q-1)` where `p` and `q` are the prime numbers used to generate `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encryption Formula:**  \n",
    "  - **Ciphertext (C)** is generated by: `C = M^e mod n`\n",
    "  - Where `M` is the plaintext message, `e` is the public exponent, and `n` is the modulus.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Decryption Formula:**  \n",
    "  - **Message (M)** is recovered by: `M = C^d mod n`\n",
    "  - Where `C` is the ciphertext, `d` is the private exponent, and `n` is the modulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modular Arithmetic:** Familiarity with modular exponentiation, the core mathematical operation in RSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Deep Technical Understanding:**\n",
    "The following deeper concepts and technical details should be understood to confidently explain how RSA works in practice, as well as the trade-offs and real-world implementation considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Generation Process:**\n",
    "  - Understand how large prime numbers are generated (e.g., using probabilistic algorithms like Miller-Rabin primality test).\n",
    "  - Explain how to compute the public and private exponents (`e` and `d`) using the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse of `e` mod ϕ(n).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Choosing `e` and `d`:**\n",
    "  - The value `e` is usually chosen as 65537 because it offers a good balance of security and computational efficiency. Understand why `e` must be coprime with `ϕ(n)`.\n",
    "  - `d` is computed as the modular inverse of `e` mod ϕ(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security Strength of RSA:**\n",
    "  - Understand **why large primes** (at least 2048 bits) are needed to secure RSA against modern attacks.\n",
    "  - Be familiar with the **difficulty of factoring** large composite numbers (the basis of RSA’s security), and the significance of quantum computing in this context (potential threat through Shor’s algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limitations of RSA:**\n",
    "  - RSA is relatively slow for encrypting large data directly. Typically, RSA is used to encrypt symmetric keys (in hybrid encryption systems) rather than large files.\n",
    "  - Be ready to explain how hybrid encryption works: RSA encrypts a symmetric key (e.g., AES key), and the symmetric key then encrypts the actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Common RSA Vulnerabilities:**\n",
    "  - Be prepared to discuss common security vulnerabilities, such as weak random number generation in prime selection, **padding attacks** (e.g., PKCS#1 v1.5 padding vulnerability), and side-channel attacks (timing attacks).\n",
    "  - Be familiar with solutions to these vulnerabilities, such as **padding schemes** like OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding) to prevent chosen-ciphertext attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Practical Implementation:**\n",
    "  - If the project involved implementing RSA, be ready to discuss how key generation, encryption, and decryption were implemented.\n",
    "  - You should be familiar with any **libraries** used (e.g., `PyCryptodome` in Python or OpenSSL), why they were chosen, and how they handle key management and padding.\n",
    "  - If applicable, discuss how you ensured the security of your implementation, such as using secure random number generation for primes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Example Project Discussion:**\n",
    "When discussing a project involving RSA, emphasize the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem Solved:** Why did you choose RSA? Was it for secure communication, data integrity, or digital signatures?\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Implementation Details:** How did you implement the RSA algorithm? Did you build it from scratch, or use a cryptographic library? Be specific about your process for key generation, encryption, and decryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance and Optimization:** How did you address RSA’s performance limitations? Did you use RSA in combination with symmetric encryption (e.g., AES for data and RSA for the key)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security Considerations:** What security measures did you take to prevent common attacks (e.g., padding schemes, key size)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Key Points to Be Confident About:**\n",
    "- You understand the **mathematical foundation** of RSA.\n",
    "- You can explain **why RSA works** and why it is secure (based on the difficulty of factoring large primes).\n",
    "- You can talk about **trade-offs** (speed, key length, security risks) and **how to mitigate** the vulnerabilities.\n",
    "- You can demonstrate how you **implemented RSA** in a project, including challenges and how you overcame them.\n",
    "\n",
    "By mastering both the conceptual and technical details of RSA, you will be well-prepared to discuss the algorithm in a coding interview, especially if it's related to a project you've worked on."

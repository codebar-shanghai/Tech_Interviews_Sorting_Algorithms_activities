    "**What is an Algorithm?**\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm is a set of instructions that is used to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task. It is a well-defined procedure that takes some input, processes it, and produces a corresponding output. Algorithms can be expressed in various forms, such as natural language, flowcharts, pseudocode, or programming languages. Bubble sort is an example of an algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a Sorting Algorithm?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A sorting algorithm is a type of algorithm that is used to arrange a list of items in a specific order, such as ascending or descending order. Sorting algorithms take a collection of data as input and produce a sorted collection as output. The goal of a sorting algorithm is to rearrange the data in a way that makes it easier to search, retrieve, or analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Bubble Sort?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly iterating through a list of items and swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm continues to iterate through the list until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted. Bubble Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that it preserves the order of equal elements, and it has a time complexity of O(n^2), making it less efficient than other sorting algorithms for large datasets. However, Bubble Sort is easy to implement and can be useful for small datasets or educational purposes."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Prerequisites:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is Top-Down Programming?**\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **What is Pair Coding?**\n",
    "   - Pair coding, also known as pair programming, involves two developers working together at the same workstation. One person writes the code (the \"Driver\"), while the other reviews each line as it is written (the \"Navigator\"). They switch roles frequently.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     - One partner writes the Bubble Sort algorithm while the other checks the logic and ensures it follows the problem requirements. After completing part of the code, they switch roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n",
    "   - Visit the provided link and read through **LeetCode Problem 881. Boats to Save People**. Make sure both partners understand the problem statement, input, and output requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Step 2: Apply Top-Down Programming**\n",
    "   - Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems. Discuss with your partner the main function and the necessary smaller steps to solve the problem.\n",
    "   - For example:\n",
    "     1. Identify the heaviest and lightest people that can be paired.\n",
    "     2. Write a function to determine if they can share a boat.\n",
    "     3. Implement the logic to count the minimum number of boats.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Step 3: Pair Code**\n",
    "   - One partner should begin coding while the other provides feedback and ensures the logic is correct. Take turns as Driver and Navigator.\n",
    "   - Start by writing the function to implement the Bubble Sort algorithm if necessary.\n",
    "   - Use top-down programming to implement the solution for the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Step 4: Test and Debug**\n",
    "   - After writing the code, test it using the test cases provided in the problem statement.\n",
    "   - Work together to debug any issues by identifying where the logic may be incorrect, and refine the code as needed.\n",
    "   - Use the available tools on LeetCode or your preferred AI tool to assist with optimization.\n",
    "   - Make sure to discuss and understand any changes made to the code to ensure both partners grasp the reasoning behind the modifications. \n",
    "\n",

    "   - **Task:** Discuss with your partner some best practices for writing idiomatic code. Consider aspects such as:\n",
    "     - Readability: Can another developer easily understand your code?\n",
    "     - Efficiency: Does your code run efficiently without unnecessary operations?\n",
    "     - Maintainability: Is your code structured in a way that makes it easy to modify later?\n",

    "5. **Step 5: Reflect on What It Means to Know a Programming Language**\n",
    "   - **Task:** Discuss with your partner:\n",
    "     - If someone says they \"know\" a language, does that mean they have memorized every algorithm or syntax detail, or does it mean they understand how to use the language effectively and idiomatically?\n",

    "By the end of this activity, you should have a clearer understanding of the balance between algorithm memorization and writing idiomatic code. You'll also gain insights into what it means to be proficient in a programming language, focusing not only on syntax but also on using the language effectively for problem-solving."
